# Identity, Authentication, Authorization (and Audit)

## IAAA defined

In a system, every operation is performed by some *thing*.  We care what
these things are.  The _identity_ is how we know that thing.  Identities
are a business entity and may belong to people or to bots or to machines
(or whatever the business decides).  At the very least an identity gives
some unique unchanging string.  In lakeFS the identity is the user name.

_Authentication_ is the process of identifying.  Typically, the business
needs include some security around authentication.  The thing may or may
not be directly involved in every authentication.  A human authenticates
to a web service using only periodic direct involvement, and can receive
a token (possibly time-limited) for use.  Authenticating lets the system
identify the thing.  A _credential_ is a piece of controlled information
that allows a thing to authenticate.

Not all things are allowed to perform all operations.  Before allowing a
thing to perform an action the system _authorizes_ it.  Often the system
also leaves some _audit_ trail of authentications (and attempts) as well
as some or all authorizations (and attempts).

## Required and existing AAA

Required support for S3 API means some AAA features must be identical to
those in S3. Our users are almost all S3 users so their familiarity with
other features means we prefer to support those features too.

### Identity

S3 supports users and roles.  Users are typically human-shaped, machines
and robots identify as their roles.

lakeFS currently has no support for role identities.  It is not clear if
there is any current user demand for such.

### Authentication and credentials

lakeFS performs these types of authentication:

* lakeFS supports the S3 API.  So it must support S3 authentication with
  no changes otherwise existing clients cannot connect.  The common form
  is to use a secret access key credential.  So this form must always be
  supported, and is the only form currently supported.
  
  Other forms of S3 authentication include shorter term tokens.  Another
  protocol for S3 API access uses presigned URLs.

* lakeFS API requires some authentication.  Currently credentials can be
  the AWS-style secret access key or a JWT.  The CLI uses an access key,
  the GUI uses a JWT.  The GUI gets a JWT by using an access key, but it
  is should be possible to change this.

### Authorization

S3 configures authorization using IAM policies.  This is (probably) most
commonly known to our users, and existing installations already use this
form.

There are (many) other kinds of authorization languages we might use but
IAM will probably need to be supported.

On the flip side, the (apparent) lack of extensibility of IAM within AWS
may lead to requiring parallel policies have to be stored within AWS and
lakeFS.  This is made worse by users of lakeFS not necessarily being the
owners of AWS IAM policies on their data when _not_ stored on lakeFS.

### Audit

Current lakeFS performs _no_ identity-linked audit.  Some lines at DEBUG
level give the API action but the access key appears only when is has to
be fetched from the database -- and appears on a separate unlinked line:

```log
TRACE  [2021-09-27T09:46:50+03:00]pkg/db/tx.go:93 pkg/db.(*dbTx).Get SQL query executed successfully               args="[AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE]" query="SELECT * FROM auth_credentials WHERE auth_credentials.access_key_id = $1" took="987.567Âµs" type=get
...
DEBUG  [2021-09-27T09:46:50+03:00]pkg/api/controller.go:2912 pkg/api.(*Controller).LogAction performing API action                         action=list_policies host="localhost:8000" message_type=action method=GET path="/api/v1/auth/policies?prefix=&after=&amount=100" request_id=ae2fbb59-f54f-4cb4-a25c-7dd1d7280538 service=api_gateway service_name=rest_api
```

A usable audit log would require at least:

1. Identities not credential IDs.
1. Identities linked to actions.
1. Explicit authentication events linking identities to credentials used
   to authenticate.
